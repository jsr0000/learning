Just playing around with Mina. Just a simple contract deployed and then an interactions script to add one to the number, updating the state on-chain.

## How to build and run the script

```sh
npm run build && node build/src/interact.js
```

## How to run tests

```sh
npm run test
npm run testw # watch mode
```

## How to run coverage

```sh
npm run coverage
```
